## 0x1A. C - Hash tables
### Problem description:
Write a program that implements hash table data structure and includes the following methods: insert, delete, search, display all elements in the hash table. The
Implement a hash table in C with the following methods:
- insert(key, value): Inserts a key-value pair into the hash table. If the key already exists, it updates its corresponding
- insert(key, value): Inserts a key-value pair into the hash table. If there is already an entry for this key,
- insert(key, value): Inserts a key-value pair into the hash table. If the key already exists, it overwrites
the old value.
- getValue(key): Returns the value associated with the given key. If no such key is present, returns NULL.
- remove(key): Removes the entry for the given key from the hash table and returns its value. If there was no
such key, returns NULL.
- print(): Prints all entries of the hash table.
You can use any data structure to implement this hash table. For example, you could use an array or linked list.
